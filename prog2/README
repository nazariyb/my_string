it is thought that terminal is opened in the next path
../prog2$, where:
some_folder/
    |
    |__/library/
    |    |
    |    |__/bin/
    |    |   |
    |    |   |__/lib_my_string.so
    |    |
    |    |__(other files)
    |
    |__/prog2/
         |
         |__/bin/
         |   |
         |   |__/prog2
         |
         |__(other files)

to build executable using cmake you should enter the next commands
1)../prog2$ mkdir <build folder> && cd <build folder>

f. e.
../prog2$ mkdir build && cd build

2)../prog2/<build folder>$ cmake .. && make

f. e.
..prog2/build$ cmake .. && make

3)../prog2/<build folder>$ cd ..

now, you can run program calling it with arguments:
    <input file name>.txt* (required)
    <input file name>.<extension> (optional, it will be autogenerated otherwise)
    *it's required for input file to be a text document (with extension ".txt")

it will be look like:
../prog2$ ./bin/prog2 <input file name>.txt

f. e.
../prog2$ ./bin/prog2 sample.txt
